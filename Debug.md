# Debugging

This project is configured to use devcontainers with Visual Studio code.

*Prerequisites:*

- Docker CE installed and working(On Windows WSL2 is absolutely encouraged)
- Visual Studio code installed
- Code extension for Dev Containers

*Steps*

1.  Launch root folder of repository in Vs Code:

```sh
:~/git/ha-xcomfort-bridge$ code .

```

2.  After VS Code is loaded, you should be prompted to re-open folder in container.  Do so.  This _might_ take a few minutes, but be patient.
3.  Once this is done, everything should be set up.  Hit F5 to debug your code inside a running HomeAssistant instance
4.  Open a browser to http://localhost:9123 (not 8123 !!) and complete the onboarding proccess and add your integration.

*Troubleshooting*

The dev container we are using, is based on `ghcr.io/ludeeus/devcontainer/integration` , which is a specialized container for developing extensions
for HomeAssistant.  You can change running HomeAssistant version and other parameters by running command `container` from a shell inside visual studio.
